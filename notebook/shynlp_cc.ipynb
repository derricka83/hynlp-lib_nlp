# HYNLP Core Concepts

## Theoretical Foundations

In this section, we delve into the 
theoretical foundations of hybrid 
natural language processing (HYNLP). 
We explore the underlying principles 
that guide the integration of classical 
NLP techniques with quantum-inspired 
approaches.

### Classical NLP Theory

Classical NLP theory forms the basis for 
understanding traditional methods of natural 
language processing. We cover concepts such 
as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, 
and syntactic parsing.

```python
def tokenize(text):
    """Tokenizes the input text."""
    return text.split()

def pos_tag(tokens):
    """Performs part-of-speech tagging on the input tokens."""
    # Implementation of POS tagging algorithm
    pass

def syntactic_parse(sentence):
    """Performs syntactic parsing on the input sentence."""
    # Implementation of syntactic parsing algorithm
    pass
```

### Quantum Computing Principles

To comprehend HYNLP fully, it's essential to have a basic 
understanding of quantum computing principles. We provide an 
introductory overview of quantum mechanics, qubits, and quantum gates.

```python
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, Aer, execute

# Example quantum circuit to create a superposition state
qc = QuantumCircuit(1, 1)
qc.h(0)
qc.measure(0, 0)

backend = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
job = execute(qc, backend)
result = job.result()
counts = result.get_counts()
print(counts)
```

## Hybrid NLP Overview

In this section, we provide a comprehensive overview of 
how HYNLP integrates classical and quantum approaches to 
natural language processing. We discuss the synergy between 
classical NLP techniques and quantum-inspired algorithms, 
highlighting the advantages of hybrid models.

### Quantum-Inspired Text Encoding

One key aspect of HYNLP is its ability to encode text into 
quantum-inspired formats. We demonstrate various encoding 
schemes and their applications in hybrid NLP models.

```python
def encode_text(text):
    """Encodes the input text using quantum-inspired encoding."""
    # Implementation of text encoding algorithm
    pass
```

### Decoding Quantum Representations

Once text is encoded into quantum-inspired formats, it needs to 
be decoded back into classical representations. We explain the 
decoding process and its significance in HYNLP.

```python
def decode_text(encoded_text):
    """Decodes the input text from quantum-inspired format."""
    # Implementation of text decoding algorithm
    pass
```
